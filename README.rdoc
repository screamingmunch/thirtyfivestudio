A solo project built for a camera rental website. Users are able to submit booking requests and browse through available gear.
It is built from the ground-up utilizing Ruby on Rails with devise for authentication. The gallery page uses isotope for animated responsive display; the app uses Mailgun via Action Mailer with a SMTP adapter to send email notifications to the users.
